I am a **Computer Engineering student** passionate about **electronics, IoT, and networking**. My goal is to build innovative, practical projects that combine creativity with technical precision.  

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:  
- **🎧 ESP32 Media Player**: Uploading podcasts to ESP32 for on-the-go listening.  
- **🔊 Light Stabilizer with Ultrasound**: Using sound waves to balance objects mid-air.  
- **⚙️ IoT Car Controller**: A web-controlled vehicle with **ESP32 automation**.  
- **💻 Morse Code Encryption System**: Translating button sequences into real-time messages.
- **🌐 [VisPro](https://vispro.vercel.app)**: A visual and interactive simulation that explains the fundamentals of **Projectile Motion**. It demonstrates how physics concepts like initial velocity, launch angle, and gravity work together to influence the trajectory of an object. Whether you're a student learning about physics or simply someone fascinated by the science behind motion, this simulation makes learning fun and engaging!  
 

### 🌱 I’m currently learning: 
- **Firebase**: Integrating it with **ReactJS** for dynamic web apps.  
- **Oracle 19c**: Expanding my knowledge of database management systems.  



### ⚡ Fun Fact:  
- I love combining physics concepts with coding to create **innovative mechatronics systems**!
